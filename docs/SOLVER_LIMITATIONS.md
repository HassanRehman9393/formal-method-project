# Solver Limitations and Best Practices

This document outlines the known limitations of the verification solver and provides best practices for working with it effectively.

## Known Limitations

### Theoretical Limitations

1. **Decidability**: 
   - The SMT solver cannot guarantee decidability for arbitrary constraints. Some problems are undecidable by their nature.
   - For certain constraint classes, the solver may not terminate or may require excessive resources.

2. **Completeness**: 
   - Our incremental solving approach is sound but not complete for all theories.
   - The solver may return "unknown" for some complex constraints, especially those involving non-linear arithmetic or quantifiers.

3. **NP-Completeness**: 
   - The boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is NP-complete, meaning that some problems may take exponential time to solve.
   - Verification of complex programs can become computationally infeasible as program size increases.

### Implementation Limitations

1. **Timeout Handling**:
   - Default timeout is 10 seconds, which may be insufficient for very complex programs.
   - The adaptive timeout approach has a maximum limit of 30 seconds by default.
   - After reaching the maximum timeout, the solver returns "unknown" instead of a definitive result.

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - The solver may consume significant memory when handling large arrays or complex constraints.
   - Current implementation limits the number of solver instances to 50 to prevent memory leaks.
   - Memory usage can grow exponentially with the complexity of constraints.

3. **Array Handling**:
   - Arrays with very large sizes (>10,000 elements) can cause performance degradation.
   - Complex array operations involving multiple nested arrays can be inefficient.
   - Theory of arrays with complex indices or nested access patterns may lead to solver timeouts.

4. **Quantifiers**:
   - The solver has limited support for quantified formulas.
   - Universal and existential quantifiers can make verification significantly slower.
   - Avoid using quantifiers when possible, or ensure they have finite domains.

5. **Non-linear Arithmetic**:
   - Operations involving multiplication, division, and modulo with variables can slow down verification.
   - Non-linear constraints may lead to incomplete results or timeouts.
   - Solver performance degrades significantly with transcendental functions (sin, cos, exp, etc.).

6. **Floating-Point Operations**:
   - Limited support for floating-point arithmetic.
   - Floating-point operations may introduce imprecision in verification results.

7. **API Limitations**:
   - Rate limiting restricts heavy usage (20 verification requests per minute).
   - Response caching is limited to 100 entries with a 10-minute TTL.
   - Cache invalidation might not be immediate when verification options change.

## Best Practices

### Constraint Optimization

1. **Simplify Constraints**:
   - Always enable constraint optimization for better performance.
   - Remove redundant assertions manually when possible.
   - Break complex assertions into simpler ones.

2. **Array Usage**:
   - Limit array sizes to what's necessary for verification.
   - Enable array optimization for better performance.
   - Define precise array bounds when possible.

3. **Incremental Solving**:
   - Use incremental solving for related verification tasks.
   - Group similar verification tasks to benefit from the solver instance reuse.
   - Clear solver instances periodically to free memory.

### Verification Options

1. **Timeouts**:
   - Set appropriate timeouts based on program complexity.
   - Use adaptive timeout for complex verifications.
   - Consider simplifying the program if timeouts occur frequently.

2. **Loop Handling**:
   - Keep loop unroll depth as low as possible (default is 5).
   - Use loop invariants instead of deep unrolling when possible.
   - Break complex loops into simpler ones.

3. **Performance Settings**:
   - Enable constraint optimization for all verifications.
   - Enable array optimization when working with arrays.
   - Use the `/set-options` endpoint to configure default options.

### Error Handling

1. **Timeout Errors**:
   - Incrementally increase timeouts if verification times out.
   - Simplify the program or assertions if timeouts persist.
   - Consider using the adaptive timeout feature.

2. **Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce constraint complexity or array sizes.
   - Clear solver instances and cache if memory usage is high.
   - Break verification into smaller parts.

3. **Unknown Results**:
   - Review constraints for potential simplifications.
   - Check for non-linear arithmetic or quantifiers.
   - Consider using approximation techniques if exact verification is infeasible.

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use SSA Form**:
   - Convert programs to SSA form before verification when possible.
   - SSA form simplifies constraint generation and improves solver performance.

2. **Batch Verifications**:
   - Group related verification tasks to benefit from caching.
   - Use the same solver instance for similar verification tasks.

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache computationally expensive verification results.
   - Invalidate cache when the program or verification options change.
   - Use the `/clear-cache` endpoint when needed.

4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use the `/performance-stats` endpoint to monitor solver performance.
   - Adjust verification strategies based on performance statistics.

5. **Equivalence Checking**:
   - Specify only relevant output variables for equivalence checking.
   - Avoid checking equivalence of entire programs when possible.
   - Use variable renaming to avoid name conflicts.

## Edge Cases to Avoid

1. **Infinite Loops**:
   - The solver cannot verify termination of arbitrary programs.
   - Use explicit bounds for all loops to ensure termination.

2. **Division by Zero**:
   - Add explicit preconditions to prevent division by zero.
   - The solver may generate spurious counterexamples involving division by zero.

3. **Integer Overflow**:
   - Be aware that the solver assumes unbounded integers by default.
   - Add explicit constraints for bounded integers if needed.

4. **Large Constants**:
   - Avoid using very large integer constants (near MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
   - Large constants can lead to solver inefficiency.

5. **Complex Bit Manipulation**:
   - Bit manipulation operations can be inefficient to verify.
   - Use higher-level abstractions when possible.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Verification Times Out**:
   - Increase the timeout value.
   - Simplify the program or assertions.
   - Enable constraint optimization.
   - Use incremental solving if appropriate.

2. **High Memory Usage**:
   - Reduce array sizes.
   - Clear solver instances with `clearSolverInstances()`.
   - Break verification into smaller parts.

3. **Unexpected Counterexamples**:
   - Check for missing preconditions.
   - Verify that the assertion accurately represents the intended property.
   - Look for potential overflow or underflow issues.

4. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Batch verification requests when possible.
   - Implement client-side caching.
   - Spread verification requests over time.

5. **Slow Verification**:
   - Check for complex constraints or non-linear arithmetic.
   - Enable constraint optimization.
   - Review the program for simplification opportunities.

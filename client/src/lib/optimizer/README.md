# SSA Optimization Module

This module provides a framework for analyzing and optimizing programs in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form.

## Available Optimizations

### Constant Propagation

Identifies variables that hold constant values and replaces uses of these variables with their constant values. This simplifies expressions and enables further optimizations.

**Implementation**: `constantPropagation.js`

### Dead Code Elimination

Removes instructions that have no effect on program output. This includes assignments to variables that are never used and unreachable code.

**Implementation**: `deadCodeElimination.js`

### Common Subexpression Elimination

Identifies expressions that are computed multiple times with the same value and replaces subsequent computations with a reference to the previously computed value.

**Implementation**: `commonSubexpressionElimination.js`

## Optimization Pipeline

The optimizations can be applied individually or as part of a comprehensive optimization pipeline. The pipeline applies optimizations iteratively until a fixed point is reached or a maximum number of iterations is performed.

**Implementation**: `optimizationPipeline.js`

## Data Flow Analysis Framework

The module includes a generic framework for data flow analysis, which is used by the optimizations to analyze program properties such as reaching definitions, live variables, and available expressions.

**Implementation**: `dataFlowAnalysis.js`

## SSA Graph

The module uses a graph representation of SSA-form programs to facilitate analysis and transformation. The graph includes nodes (basic blocks), edges (control flow), and additional information such as dominators and dominance frontiers.

**Implementation**: `ssaGraph.js`

## Usage

```javascript
import { optimizeSSA } from './optimizer/index.js';

// Apply optimizations to an SSA program
const { program: optimizedProgram, metadata } = optimizeSSA(ssaProgram, {
  constantPropagation: true,
  deadCodeElimination: true,
  commonSubexpressionElimination: true,
  iterations: 3,
  trackChanges: true
});

// The optimized program can be used for further processing
// such as SMT generation and verification
```

## Testing

Run the optimization tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:optimizations
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Loop-invariant Code Motion**: Move invariant code out of loops
- **Strength Reduction**: Replace expensive operations with cheaper ones
- **Copy Propagation**: Eliminate redundant copy operations
- **Partial Redundancy Elimination**: Remove redundant computations on some paths
